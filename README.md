This is an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server template, using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.

## Structure

The file structure for this project is loosely based on the structure laid out by [this blog post](https://www.coreycleary.me/project-structure-for-an-express-rest-api-when-there-is-no-standard-way). The aim is to separate server logic from business logic to more easily manage a growing/changing API backend.

## Additions

Some boilerplate packages and workflows have been added to speed up the beginning stages of development. These include:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) with [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) for automatic linting when making commits
